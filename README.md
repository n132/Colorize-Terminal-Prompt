# Colorize-Terminal-Prompt

Cooler work has been done at [`lolcat`](https://github.com/busyloop/lolcat). So this project doesn't need to exist.


# Linux
```sh
sudo apt install lolcat
echo "edit ~/.config/prompt to change the graph" > ~/.config/prompt
echo "\nlolcat ~/.config/prompt" >> ~/.zshrc
```
