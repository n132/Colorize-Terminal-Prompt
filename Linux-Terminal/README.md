# Linux Terminal
* I use zsh and the configure file is `~/.zshrc`.


# Usage
- Modify the source [code](./main.c) to replace `/root/conf/prompt` with the path of your logo/prompt
- run command `make` to make the binary
- Append the command `<path_to_binary>` to your shell configure file, e.g. `~/.zshrc`
